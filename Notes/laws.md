Organisms can store minerals
Organisms cannot use the minerals they store
Therefore organisms can live off of the minerals they inherit from their parents

# Key

### Units
e = 1 energy
$ = cost
t = 1 moment
Cg = 1 cargogen
s = 1 tile
s = 1 tile of moment
A = ability
m = mass
-> produces

### Abilities
mA = movement ability
pA = photosynthesis ability
dA = digestion ability

### Mass
1e (of storage)= 1m
1mA = 1m
1pA = 1m
1dA = 1m


### Production and abilities per t
mA + 1e -> move 1s
1Cg w/ pA -> 1e

### Reproduction
1e given by parent -> 1e for child
2e -> pA for child
2e -> mA for child
2e -
